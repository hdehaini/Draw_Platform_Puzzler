## Game Mechanics

### Drawing Platforms
- Click and drag with the left mouse button to draw a platform
- Platforms must be at least 30 pixels long to be created
- The preview line shows green when the platform is long enough, red when too short
- Platforms are created horizontally between your start and end points

### Platform Management
- Each level has a limit on how many platforms you can draw simultaneously
- Platform limits increase with level progression for added strategic depth
- Platforms automatically disappear after 5 seconds
- A timer shows how much time is left for each platform
- Use the 'N' key to clear all drawn platforms if you need to start over

### Special Elements
- **Moving Platforms (Light Blue)**: Move back and forth between set points - time your jumps!
- **Spike Traps (Red)**: Touching spikes resets your position - avoid at all costs!
- **Disappearing Platforms (Orange)**: Flash as a warning, then vanish when stepped on
- **Collectibles (Gold Diamonds)**: Collect for bonus points and bragging rights

### Physics
- The player has realistic gravity and momentum
- Jump only when on solid ground
- Collision detection works for all platform edges (top, bottom, sides)
- Moving platforms carry the player along

### Level Generation
- Each level is procedurally generated with carefully balanced challenges
- Goals are positioned to require strategic thinking and platform usage
- Level layouts ensure solvability while maintaining difficulty
- Special elements are introduced progressively
- No two playthroughs are exactly the same!

## Tips for Success
- Plan your platform placement before drawing
- Watch the timers - platforms disappear quickly!
- Use the minimum number of platforms needed
- Sometimes you need to wait for old platforms to disappear before drawing new ones
- Practice the timing - you might need to draw platforms while moving
- Learn the different level types and adapt your strategy accordingly
- Higher levels give you more platforms to work with, but also present greater challenges
- **Moving Platforms**: Time your jumps and sometimes ride them to reach distant areas
- **Spike Levels**: Plan safe routes and use platforms to bridge over dangerous areas
- **Disappearing Platforms**: Move quickly and have backup platforms ready
- **Collectibles**: Don't risk your life for points, but grab them when safe

## Level Type Strategies
- **Horizontal Gaps**: Focus on timing and distance - don't waste platforms on short jumps
- **Vertical Climb**: Plan your route upward, sometimes zigzagging is more efficient
- **Mixed Challenge**: Combine horizontal and vertical strategies
- **Maze Navigation**: Look for the optimal path before drawing any platforms
- **Timing Challenge**: These levels test your ability to draw platforms while moving
- **Moving Platforms**: Learn the movement patterns and time your approach
- **Spike Gauntlet**: Safety first - use platforms to create safe paths over danger
- **Disappearing Platforms**: Speed and backup plans are key to success

Enjoy the infinite puzzle-solving adventure with exciting new challenges!
